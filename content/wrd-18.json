A year removed from the four billion dollar purchase of the UFC, the eerie silence of new owners, WME, continues as UFC wrap up a lackluster year. Paling in comparison both financially and in terms of public interest, the promotion is clearly hurting from the absences of mainstream stars Conor Mcgregor and Ronda Rousey. The return of stars like Georges St-Pierre and Jon Jones aided greatly over the last 12 months, however, both returns are now marked with massive asterisks--with Jon Jones facing another drug suspension and GSP vacating his belt due to battling colitis from weight complications. Negotiations for a new television deal continue to transpire. Things are looking to be headed in a relatively positive direction for th UFC, and it would seem they are set to receive a bump in their deal with FOX. Although, itâ€™s clear that the company would have a great deal more confidence had 2017 been as great a year as 2016 was.---",

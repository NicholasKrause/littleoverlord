		"body_1": "Recently I was tasked with creating a Frequently Asked Questions page for an e-commerce site. Herein I describe my adventures.---The FAQ has a rich history beginning way back in the Internet stone-age.  Unfortunately the venerable FAQ has fallen on hard times. Many poor FAQs have degraded into marketing points instead of actual helpful guidance. However, I do think that there may be a bright future for the old FAQ. Today’s new and shiny technologies seek to anticipate users’ needs through machine learning. By aggregating past requests they can recommend better future requests. In a way that is what a FAQ was meant to do.",

		"body_3": "What we need to do is make the FAQ more relevant and credible. It needs to be driven by a trusted source that can intuit by context what a user’s question is likely to be. In my situation that was the customer service department. They provided a detailed list of every possible question that a user could have on each page sorted by likelihood. Cool.---As the copywriter just I needed break it down into simple, easy to understand jargon-free assistance. I implement an information architecture allowing the questions fit into categories.There needed to be a many-to-many relationship between categories and questions, because the same question might exist under different categories. As my contribution to the microcopy universe, I created a button titled -DQ-Ask a Question-DQ-. See what I did there? I planted the notion that these questions are submitted by actual end users.",

		"body_4": "As the UX developer I needed to facilitate the information scent and provide discoverability. The layout was a collection of categorized (#materialdesign) collapsible cards. An ever present search facility and sub-category jump menu meant that any question could be found with just a few taps. I also used the JavaScript history API so the back and forward buttons could be used to traverse the question cards without leaving the page (SPA).---Finally, let's make our FAQ contextually relevant. We can that by creating deep-links to specific questions throughout our website. Anywhere the user may get confused there should be a contextual FAQ link. These links can point to a category of questions or to a specific question. How convenient!",

		"body_1": "10. Thumper  - violent rhythm/music/trance inducing/visceral graphics---9. Final Fantasy XV -good characterization/first good single player final fantasy game in two over a decade/fun combat/interesting premise/great and numerous endearing nuances/ despite its many downfalls i cared about the outcome of the world and its effect on the characters.",

		"body_2": "8. Forza Horizon 3 -perfect combination of -DQ-oh that car is shiny-DQ- and -DQ-how far can i hurl it through the air-DQ- / not usually a fan of realistic racing games / toes the line beautifully between the love of cars and love of arcadey racing games---7. Overwatch - unparalleled world building/extremely diverse and unique cast/good focus on positive aspects of playing/may be the best in a oversaturated genre",

		"body_3": "6. Uncharted 4 - told the best story in a series that i thought i no longer cared for / typical usage of every single ounce of the playstations power/previously thought many games had -DQ-out-uncharted-DQ- uncharted but no longer feel that way.---5. Titanfall 2 - genuis level design / assembly line level comes to mind / mechanics are always fresh and never overstay welcome / nails movement and subsequent satisfaction / best and most fun FPS multiplayer in years if not my favorite ever / good relationship between BT and Cooper / fun and campy story / campaign leaves me wanting more but not in a way where i feel it’s unfinished or the length is necessarily a detriment ",

		"body_4": "4. Inside - unparalleled animations and atmosphere/tense all the way until the strange and cathartic ending / good length / game i will show people that don’t play games---3. Doom- best FPS campaign in many years if not ever. Music is even better if that was possible / doom slayer doesn’t give a fuck / combat is the greatest feeling combat ever / implementation of skill trees and runes at first seems bad but then ends up adding a lot to the gameplay / big surprise considering reception of multiplayer beta and lack of review codes sent out to press / best eight or so hours i’ve spent in a single video this year and in many years / excellent console versions and fantastic PC versions that would put many other AAA games to shame / After wolfenstein and DLC and DOOM ID might be my favorite developer currently",

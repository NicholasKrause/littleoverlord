		"body_1": "-B-10. Thumper--E- As described on its Steam store page, Thumper is a -DQ-rhythm violence-DQ- game. From the first level until the last, the percussion heavy soundtrack had me entranced, nervous and physically tense. The visuals are oppressive: think industrial machinery meets psychedelia. Admittedly, Thumper doesn’t do much; however, what it does it manage to do it does so better than any other rhythm game I’ve seen--if a similar game even exists. Thumper employes all the mechanics you might expect from a on-rails rhythm game, but it is unmatched with its violent player movement, brutal visuals, and mean, iron-fisted industrial soundtrack. I’m not sure what Thumper’s replayability will be in the future but I’m confident in saying that for the five or six hours it took to complete it, I was never more glued to my computer screen at any other point this past year.  --- -B-9. Final Fantasy XV-E- -All I’ve ever wanted is a good road trip game. At first, FFXV’s characters looked to be off-putting and uninteresting but by the end of the game I cared about them way more than I thought possible. This was achieved through some pretty solid, albeit sometimes campy, writing, minute interactions and humorous characterization. The best aspect of FFXV is the roadtripping and adventuring between Noctis and his pals. It really helped that I tampered my expectations for this game, as I felt that prior to it there hasn’t been a good mainline Final Fantasy game in over a decade. It’s not to say that my middling expectations were blown out of the water: The story is intriguing but many of the key points in the plot were only clear because I happened to watch the Kingsglaive companion movie beforehand. Without the movie, a few important events and character motivations would’ve been lost on me, because the information is just not present in the base game. Despite this, the first half of FFXV, in particular, is a really good time. I echo the sentiments of many other reviews in regards to latter-half of the game. Aside from wrapping the story up in a very devastating, emotional and bitter-sweet way, the fun gameplay and open-world shenanigans suddenly disappear past a certain point, as if suddenly pushed off a cliff. Final Fantasy XV isn't the world-eating, system selling game some might have thought it to be prior to release; however, it does what it manages to get right very well and made this list as a result. It’s not a game I’ll soon forget.",

		"body_2": "-B-8. Forza Horizon 3-E- -There’s not much to say about Forza Horizon 3 as a sequel except that it is a good one of those: A fantastic mix of arcade and simulation car racing. Oh yeah, and it looks fucking amazing. I don’t consider myself a car person by any stretch of the imagination and yet I found myself inspecting and customizing the large roster of incredibly-detailed cars and taking way too many pictures with the photo mode. It’s quite clear the love of cars, racing, and most importantly:  adventure, that goes into these games. This is of course in regards to the visuals but also the gameplay and world design. Australia was a really neat idea for a locale, with the deserts, forests, and cities adding a ton of depth to the map. The races are diverse both in structure and terrain: at the right difficulty it feels like I’m just edging everyone else for the win. It’s a shame the PC version suffered from a ridiculous amount of technical issues, as 60 FPS is clearly the way to experience Forza. I must admit that the Xbox version was more than serviceable and the inclusion of cross-buy between the two systems dampened the blow, but it’s not far from acceptable to release the PC version in such a broken state. I clocked in around fifty hours on the Xbox version, completing the main story long before that, and there’s still more to do with a steady flow of post-release content. Hey, who knew driving games could be so fun! I sure as hell didn’t. --- -B-7. Overwatch-E- - unparalleled world building/extremely diverse and unique cast/good focus on positive aspects of playing/may be the best in a oversaturated genre",

		"body_3": "-B-6. Uncharted 4-E- - told the best story in a series that i thought i no longer cared for / typical usage of every single ounce of the playstations power/previously thought many games had -DQ-out-uncharted-DQ- uncharted but no longer feel that way.--- -B-5. Titanfall 2-E- - genuis level design / assembly line level comes to mind / mechanics are always fresh and never overstay welcome / nails movement and subsequent satisfaction / best and most fun FPS multiplayer in years if not my favorite ever / good relationship between BT and Cooper / fun and campy story / campaign leaves me wanting more but not in a way where i feel it’s unfinished or the length is necessarily a detriment ",

		"body_4": "-B-4. Inside-E- - unparalleled animations and atmosphere/tense all the way until the strange and cathartic ending / good length / game i will show people that don’t play games--- -B-3. Doom-E- -best FPS campaign in many years if not ever. Music is even better if that was possible / doom slayer doesn’t give a fuck / combat is the greatest feeling combat ever / implementation of skill trees and runes at first seems bad but then ends up adding a lot to the gameplay / big surprise considering reception of multiplayer beta and lack of review codes sent out to press / best eight or so hours i’ve spent in a single video this year and in many years / excellent console versions and fantastic PC versions that would put many other AAA games to shame / After wolfenstein and DLC and DOOM ID might be my favorite developer currently",

The Witness-E- - best atmosphere and visuals this year / frustrating but never unfair / a long lasting example of mastership in the craft of game development / every inch of this map is beautiful / breathtaking with fantastic gameplay to boot / evokes strange and unique emotions----B-1. Hitman-E- - perhaps one of my favorite games of all time / replayability is thru the roof / played all missions to level 20 mastery and beyond / have all trophies save for one / shame there’s no platinum trophy / ps4 has long load times but looks good and PC version is fantastic / constant flow of content from summer bonus episodes to elusive targets to holiday episode / best level design in any hitman game to date / the first true realization of a moving place in time and deep mechanics and consequences for all the players actions that disrupt and alter the state of large groups of people and their many varied functions surrounding the maps / best use of episodic content i’ve ever seen and first case of it in which i prefer that to be the way it's done / great mix of humor absurdity and serious stealth action and protagonistic and surrounding story",

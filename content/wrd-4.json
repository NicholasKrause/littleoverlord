Final Fantasy XV -good characterization/first good single player final fantasy game in two over a decade/fun combat/interesting premise/great and numerous endearing nuances/ despite its many downfalls i cared about the outcome of the world and its effect on the characters.",

Forza Horizon 3 -perfect combination of -DQ-oh that car is shiny-DQ- and -DQ-how far can i hurl it through the air-DQ- / not usually a fan of realistic racing games / toes the line beautifully between the love of cars and love of arcadey racing games---7. Overwatch - unparalleled world building/extremely diverse and unique cast/good focus on positive aspects of playing/may be the best in a oversaturated genre",

Uncharted 4 - told the best story in a series that i thought i no longer cared for / typical usage of every single ounce of the playstations power/previously thought many games had -DQ-out-uncharted-DQ- uncharted but no longer feel that way.---5. Titanfall 2 - genuis level design / assembly line level comes to mind / mechanics are always fresh and never overstay welcome / nails movement and subsequent satisfaction / best and most fun FPS multiplayer in years if not my favorite ever / good relationship between BT and Cooper / fun and campy story / campaign leaves me wanting more but not in a way where i feel itâ€™s unfinished or the length is necessarily a detriment ",

		"body_1": "-B-10. Thumper--E- As described on its Steam store page, Thumper is a -DQ-rhythm violence-DQ- game. From the first level until the last, the percussion heavy soundtrack had me entranced, nervous and physically tense. The visuals are oppressive: think industrial machinery meets psychedelia. Admittedly, Thumper doesn’t do much; however, what it does it manage to do it does so better than any other rhythm game I’ve seen--if a similar game even exists. Thumper employes all the mechanics you might expect from a on-rails rhythm game, but it is unmatched with its violent player movement, brutal visuals, and mean, iron-fisted industrial soundtrack. I’m not sure what Thumper’s replayability will be in the future but I’m confident in saying that for the five or six hours it took to complete it, I was never more glued to my computer screen at any other point this past year.  --- -B-9. Final Fantasy XV-E- -All I’ve ever wanted is a good road trip game. At first, FFXV’s characters looked to be off-putting and uninteresting but by the end of the game I cared about them way more than I thought possible. This was achieved through some pretty solid, albeit sometimes campy, writing, minute interactions and humorous characterization. The best aspect of FFXV is the roadtripping and adventuring between Noctis and his pals. It really helped that I tampered my expectations for this game, as I felt that prior to it there hasn’t been a good mainline Final Fantasy game in over a decade. It’s not to say that my middling expectations were blown out of the water: The story is intriguing but many of the key points in the plot were only clear because I happened to watch the Kingsglaive companion movie beforehand. Without the movie, a few important events and character motivations would’ve been lost on me, because the information is just not present in the base game. Despite this, the first half of FFXV, in particular, is a really good time. I echo the sentiments of many other reviews in regards to latter-half of the game. Aside from wrapping the story up in a very devastating, emotional and bitter-sweet way, the fun gameplay and open-world shenanigans suddenly disappear past a certain point, as if suddenly pushed off a cliff. Final Fantasy XV isn't the world-eating, system selling game some might have thought it to be prior to release; however, it does what it manages to get right very well and made this list as a result. It’s not a game I’ll soon forget.",

		"body_2": "-B-8. Forza Horizon 3-E- -There’s not much to say about Forza Horizon 3 as a sequel except that it is a good one of those: A fantastic mix of arcade and simulation car racing. Oh yeah, and it looks fucking amazing. I don’t consider myself a car person by any stretch of the imagination and yet I found myself inspecting and customizing the large roster of incredibly-detailed cars and taking way too many pictures with the photo mode. It’s quite clear the love of cars, racing, and most importantly:  adventure, that goes into these games. This is of course in regards to the visuals but also the gameplay and world design. Australia was a really neat idea for a locale, with the deserts, forests, and cities adding a ton of depth to the map. The races are diverse both in structure and terrain: at the right difficulty it feels like I’m just edging everyone else for the win. It’s a shame the PC version suffered from a ridiculous amount of technical issues, as 60 FPS is clearly the way to experience Forza. I must admit that the Xbox version was more than serviceable and the inclusion of cross-buy between the two systems dampened the blow, but it’s not far from acceptable to release the PC version in such a broken state. I clocked in around fifty hours on the Xbox version, completing the main story long before that, and there’s still more to do with a steady flow of post-release content. Hey, who knew driving games could be so fun! I sure as hell didn’t. --- -B-7. Overwatch-E- - Blizzard’s ability to hop into a brand new game genre and then go on to dominate it shouldn’t surprise me at this point, yet here we are. Not only did Overwatch land in an oversaturated, flavor-of-the-month type genre (class-based shooter), it hit the ground running: There’s little denying that Overwatch is the defacto class-based shooter on the market. At the very least, in terms of popularity. I’m going to take it one step further and assert that in terms of how the game feels, the competitive action, the community, and the graphics, Overwatch is damn near perfect. Even if it’s not your preferred type of game, and hey it’s all the way up at #7 on my list, this game deserves its props. If the player base, post-launch content, developer pedigree, and the already quite large eSports scene are any indication, then I think Overwatch is staying around for a very long time. The world in which Overwatch exists seems larger than the game itself. I hope other game developers take note of Blizzard’s use of a characterization, diversity, humor, and colorful palette. The animated shorts that follow the stories of the unique cast of characters goes a long way in making the world feel like it’s own thing. The fervor around the intricacies of the characters and their relationships to one another has become a whole separate thing outside of the game itself. I feel that this helps proves the point that, especially in video games, the characterization is often more important than the plot. Yes, Overwatch is a multiplayer only game and by virtue of that, it can’t tell a story as well as some other games; however, I think this only adds to the fact that Overwatch’s story and world are met with such high levels of interest. This is because Blizzard knew how to effectively build a world in which the characters all belonged and made sense in the broader scope of the story. It reminds me greatly of how Team Fortress 2 (arguably the cornerstone of the class-based shooter genre for over a decade) did pretty much the same thing, with the backgrounds, animated shorts, and comics all adding a mystique around the characters, giving them a sort of mythic and folkloric presence in the game. Blizzard did exactly that with the characters in Overwatch, with Bastion’s animated short in particular eliciting a strong emotional reaction from me, which is unfortunately pretty rare for me in video games.",

		"body_3": "-B-6. Uncharted 4-E- - The Uncharted trilogy, along with The Last of Us, remains the bright spot of the PS3’s now definitive library. After the course of three games, there was long period of time where I thought I was done with Nathan Drake’s story. Uncharted 4 proved me wrong. As expected, developer Naughty Dog utilized every ounce of PS4’s graphically fidelity resulting in a visual experience yet to be topped by any game, both console and PC alike. The gameplay is the same as the previous three games, with the large set pieces, stunning environments, and basic gunplay. That’s okay though, as the story more than made up for the recurring familiarities. In the past, to me, the story took a backseat to the visuals and large-scale set pieces, however, this time around the story was the best part of the experience. My favorite section of the game taking place over a flashback in which you control a young Nathan Drake. There was no action, and hardly any interaction, yet I was sucked in by the story being told in front of me. With the rebooted Tomb Raider franchise being some of my favorite action-adventure games in a long time, I had previously come to the conclusion that Tomb Raider had “out Uncharted” the Uncharted series. Yet again, with the arrival of Uncharted 4, I’m glad to have been wrong. Uncharted 4, with its visuals, set pieces, and pitch-perfect conclusion to the Drake family story, cements videos games alongside every other medium of entertainment.--- -B-5. Titanfall 2-E- - Only in 2016 could a game like Titanfall 2 be number 5 on my list. If it were any other year, this superb game would number one. Perhaps the greatest shooter of the last decade, or dare I say, ever, Titanfall 2 is a prime example of why the first person shooter experience still has so much to offer, with other franchises like Call of Duty and Battlefield feeling mighty stagnant as of late. Unlike the first Titanfall, we get a campaign mode that displays genius level design, among a wide array of unique and thoughtfully doled out mechanics. I’m confident in saying Titanfall 2’s story mode is among the greatest of all time in FPS games. The soldier and robot dynamic had me wary at first, but was pulled off to great effect. If you’re one of the many people that buys shooters for the multiplayer, I highly recommend a playthrough of the quick and masterfully well-told story mode. Speaking of the multiplayer, it’s also ranks among the best the genre has ever seen. The modes are varied but not too segmented. The controls are perfect, with movement and the shooting feeling perfect. The titan drops aren’t over or under powered, and the games always feel competitive. From head to toe, Titanfall is a treat.",

		"body_4": "-B-4. Inside-E- - A rare case of auteur game making, Inside elicits a spectrum of emotions over its short story. If you’ve played the studio's last game, Limbo, then you’ll have a solid idea of what Inside is all about. With the addition of unparalleled animations, tense atmosphere, disturbing visuals, and haunting soundtrack (which was recorded through an actual human skull!), Inside will forever be the game I will showcase to people who don’t play games, as if to say, “Hey! This is why I spend so much time on video games, check out how incredible they can be”.--- -B-3. Doom-E- -Remember when I said Titanfall 2’s story mode is among the best in the genre? Well, here comes DOOM, the best first person shooter campaign of all time. That’s okay Titanfall, I still love you dearly. This game is decades removed from one of the most recognized games ever made, in the original 1992 game, DOOM. That’s a lot to live up to. A special part of what made 2016’s DOOM reboot so memorable is the lack of interest for this game, believe it or not. Over a decade in development, and after a lackluster multiplayer beta, people weren’t expecting anything from the new DOOM. Oh boy, were we wrong. Above all else, DOOM feels amazing to play. The combat is perfect, with the large, secret-ridden levels feeling just challenging enough without bringing forward too much frustration. The controls are the best I’ve ever felt in any shooter, and yes, I highly recommend playing on PC for full mouse control. From the get go, the tone of the entire story is established effectively, with the DOOM guy waking up in hell, ignoring all prompts to avoid the dangerous demons, grabbing a shotgun, and unleashing his rage on hordes of hellish creatures. DOOM guy is mad. He’s real mad. When you think of the DOOM series, you don’t think of upgrade trees and gun augmentations, let alone any other mechanics other than health, armor, keypads, and guns. This isn’t the case for the new game, and as jarring as it is to see all of these mechanics in a DOOM game, they are done quite well and add to the experience a ton. The soundtrack, courtesy of Killer Instinct composer, Mick Gordon, is among the best elements of the new DOOM. The blistering metal soundtrack is augments the demon killings a thousand percent, and makes me feel like a total badass. The DOOM campaign is the best eight or so hours of gaming I’ve experienced this year.",

		"body_5": "-B-2. The Witness-E- - A toss up between The Witness and Inside, I eventually went with my second pick here as my favorite atmosphere and visuals in a game this year. The Witness is a game I will never forget. Forever etched in soul as an equally challenging, yet calming experience: Frustrating but never unfair. Game mastermind Jonathan Blow delivered hard with his eight year project. My favorite puzzle game of all time, The Witness isn’t for the weak of heart. The puzzles get quite difficult, however, the game world and psychological ponderings (or perhaps ramblings) found throughout the island offer enough breath of fresh air for me to want to continue going mad solving these incredibly well-crafted series of puzzles. Every inch of The Witness’s gameworld is a visual treat, and evokes strong emotions that can only be understood once you spend some time with this fantastic game.----B-1. Hitman-E- - perhaps one of my favorite games of all time / replayability is thru the roof / played all missions to level 20 mastery and beyond / have all trophies save for one / shame there’s no platinum trophy / ps4 has long load times but looks good and PC version is fantastic / constant flow of content from summer bonus episodes to elusive targets to holiday episode / best level design in any hitman game to date / the first true realization of a moving place in time and deep mechanics and consequences for all the players actions that disrupt and alter the state of large groups of people and their many varied functions surrounding the maps / best use of episodic content i’ve ever seen and first case of it in which i prefer that to be the way it's done / great mix of humor absurdity and serious stealth action and protagonistic and surrounding story",

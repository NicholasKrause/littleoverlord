		"body_2": "After its release, Shenmue was no doubt the touchstone for what an open world game should be. Shenmue holds up well relative to other games of its generation. It's one of the healthier folks at the Sega retirement home, who occasionally may need a cane to hold itself up. The graphics may seem dated to someone who doesn't play older games; however, there's no denying that it clearly a took a lot of resources to make (it was, in fact, the biggest budgeted game of its time). The leap in graphics it made is arguably the greatest leap in all of gaming's history.",

		"body_3": "Yu Suzuki, the man behind Shenmue, had an incredible story that was never fully realized. This was due to an enormous budget and disappointing sales. After only two games, and an unresolved story, Shenmue halted production and left its dedicated fans to wallow in a pool of false rumors and sparse glimmers of hope for years to come.",

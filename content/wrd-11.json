"body_1": "Note: -I-Dead Cells-E- is currently in early access, although it may be the most complete early access product I’ve ever experienced.---Developed by Motion Twin, -I-Dead Cells’-E- inspirations are abundantly clear: A mix of -I-Castlevania-E- exploration, -I-Dark Souls progression-E-, and a roguelike structure. To stand out from the numerous games that we see enter the seemingly larger-and-larger void of new Steam releases, -I-Dead Cells-E- intelligently blends its own ideas of what a roguelike should be with the familiarities of other games.

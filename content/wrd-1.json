		"body_2": "It goes a little something like this: Shinya Arino, a popular Japanese comedian, is tasked with beating a retro video game in one day (the humor often originating from the fact that he isn't very good at games). This challenge, interrupted periodically by other game-related segments, comprises one episode. Generally, his goal is to reach the conclusion of the game by the end of a single work day. If the challenge proves to be too difficult, Arino can call for an extension, which allows him to save his progress and return to playing at a later date. An extension occasionally breaks the episode in two parts. Additionally, he can rely on his ADs, or Assistant Directors, to aid him in completion. The ADs are responsible for having an in-depth understanding of the game at hand. When he feels his pride is at stake, sore thumbs be damned, Arino will often opt out of any external help. It is not uncommon for him to spend multiple hours on a single level.",

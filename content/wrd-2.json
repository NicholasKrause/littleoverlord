		"body_2": "New Japan Pro Wrestling continues to be the greatest professional wrestling promotion in the world. Well, I should caution that this is all dependent on what the viewer seeks from their wrestling viewing: WWE tells many horrible, halfass stories in and outside the ring, but when they get it right it’s typically the best the industry has to offer. It should go without saying that if big matches are your cup of tea, then none do it better or more consistently than New Japan Pro Wrestling. Mindful, meaningful booking and a diverse range of stylistic matchups seem to be the key to NJPW’s success in regards to overall in-ring quality. From Kenny Omega to Ishi, Kushida, Hiroki Goto, Ricochet, The Young Bucks, and the list goes on, NJPW is in a really good place talent-wise (which is impressive considering the sudden departures of Shinsuke Nakamura and AJ Styles early last year). WWE, on the other hand, while also boasting incredible talent spread across RAW, Smackdown, NXT and 205 Live, struggles to find an “ace” or face of the company to replace John Cena, with the Roman Reigns experiment taking numerous turns in every direction. NJPW, on the other hand, have very solid aces, at least for their needs, in (possibly) Kenny Omega, Hiroshi Tanahashi, Tetsuya Naito, Kazuchika Okada, and now, I believe, Katsuyori Shibata.

		"body_3": "Overall business for NJPW hasn’t been either particularly impressive or disappointing as of late; however, the big shows are bigger than they’ve been in a long time. Their TV deal is far from ideal but their larger shows can sell out and do good business. Sakura Genesis, formerly called Invasion Attack, is yearly pay-per-view held in Ryogoku Sumo Hall, a solid typical sellout venue for big shows like the G1 Climax. NJPW rolled into Sumo Hall on April 9th for a show with a more than solid undercard and unforgettable main event that saw Okada defend the IWGP Heavyweight Championship vs. Shibata.

		"body_1": "I'm excited to announce Little Overlord's first video series, Wrestle Log. Launching in a few weeks, Wrestle Log will be a series of highly researched and informational looks at all of the wrestling video games ever published.---That's right. Every single one.---The first episode of Wrestle Log will focus on American releases for the PlayStation 1. It's only fitting that the series starts at the PS1, as these were the very first games I was exposed to as a kid.---Wrestle Log: American PS1 Releases comes out in a few weeks and will, in addition to all releases, be posted to the site. Make sure to subscribe to the Little Overlord YouTube channel for all site content coming in the near future.----Nick  ",

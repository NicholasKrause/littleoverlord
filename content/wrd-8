Dammit Cole, I think you meant it’s a night about...nevermind. Moving on. Did you know there was a WWE pay-per-view last night? Well there was. Although the go-home show for RAW last week hardly did anything to sell last night’s show, here we are. With the non-title match between Smackdown’s Randy Orton and RAW’s Bray Wyatt, a no show for the universal champion Brock Lesnar, and the confusing stipulations with Chris Jericho and Kevin Owens rematch, I hardly know what is going on. Even for WWE’s standards, the stories are way too convoluted.---Just under one month from Wrestlemania 34, Payback is the first payperview after the largest event of the year. It’s also the first payperview after the “Superstar Shakeup”, or rather, the two nights in which we switch up some of the talent while totally shattering the illusion that the management of the two brands are strategically bargaining for the company’s top talent as opposed to randomly sending wrestlers back and forth on a moment’s notice. A stark difference from this time last year, in which a proper draft was held with the main storyline being the two brands attempting to establish dominance with a superior roster. With one month being the time period for a free subscription to the WWE network, many thousands of lapsed WWE fans were treated to Payback as part of their free trial: This event was even promoted before and during Wrestlemania, as in “Hey! Sign up for a WWE network trial today and not only will you get Wrestlemania free, you’ll get the RAW exclusive Payback show for free!”. You know, the Payback show that featured neither of the world championships, isn’t exclusive to the RAW brand, and consisted of many rematches from the Wrestlemania card. Credit where credit is due, Payback ended up being a solid show, totally in spite of its buildup and nonsensical storylines. Let’s talk about some of the highlights.---",
